THE FOLLOWING GAME IS MISSING THE RESOURCE FOLDER DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT MAY CONTAIN COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL.
I DID NOT DO THIS GAME ALONE AND I'VE UPLOADED THIS IN HOPES THAT MY GROUP MEMBERS WILL SEE IT SO THAT I CAN ADD
THEM TO THE PROJECT.

THIS GAME WAS NAMED SECTORS BECAUSE WE WERE THE ONLY ONES TO IMPLENMENT A PARTITION WHERE THE GAME WOULD ONLY CALCULATE
HIT DETECTION IF AN OBJECT AND THE CHARACTER WERE ON THE SAME SECTOR THUS INCREASING EFFICIENCY.
